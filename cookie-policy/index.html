                <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Everytool.tech) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies".

                <h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
                <p>We use first and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising, analytics and other purposes.</p>
                <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our website and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.
