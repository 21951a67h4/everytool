                    <p>At Everytool.tech, our mission is simple yet powerful: to provide everyone with free access to useful online tools that simplify daily tasks and enhance productivity.</p>
                    <p>We believe that practical digital tools should be accessible to all, regardless of technical skill level or financial resources. That's why we've created this platformâ€”a comprehensive hub of utilities designed to solve common problems and streamline workflows.</p>
                    <p>By eliminating paywalls, complicated sign-ups, and intrusive ads, we're creating a space where anyone can quickly find and use exactly the tool they need, when they need it.</p>

                        <h3>The Idea</h3>
                        <p>Everytool.tech was born from a simple frustration: too many online tools hidden behind paywalls, cluttered with ads, or scattered across dozens of different websites.</p>
                        <p>I realized there was a need for a single, reliable hub where people could access all the utilities they needed without the hassle.</p>

                </div>

                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <h3>Development</h3>
                        <p>Working nights and weekends, I began building the platform from scratch, focusing on creating a clean, intuitive interface and developing the core set of tools.</p>
                        <p>The goal was simple: make every tool as straightforward and useful as possible.</p>

                        <h3>Launch</h3>
                        <p>Everytool.tech launched with an initial collection of 25 tools across 5 categories. The response was overwhelming and confirmed what I had suspected: people were hungry for a straightforward, ad-light tool platform.</p>
