# Everytool.tech ‚Äì AI Code Agent Instructions

## üîç Overview

This project hosts a collection of simple, useful web-based tools.  
Each tool has its own dedicated **URL and folder**.

Your job as an **AI Code Agent** is to generate the necessary files and structure for each new tool prompt given. Only use advanced code snippets while maintaining simplicity in the code. Remember not to create new files for each section of the entire website to fix errors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Creation Guidelines

When a new tool is added:

- Create a new folder inside the **correct category** (`calculator/`, `converter/`, `generator/`, `seo/`).
- Folder names should be:
  - **Lowercase**
  - **Dash-separated**
  - **URL-friendly**

Inside each tool's folder, generate:

- `index.html` ‚Äì Full HTML page for the tool
- `style.css` ‚Äì Specific styles for the tool
- `script.js` ‚Äì JavaScript logic (no external dependencies)

## üîó URL Structure

Each tool is hosted at a clean, readable URL. Examples:

| Tool Name          | URL Path                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Age Calculator     | `/calculator/age-calculator/`           |
| BMI Calculator     | `/calculator/bmi-calculator/`           |
| Currency Converter | `/converter/currency-converter/`        |
| QR Generator       | `/generator/qr-code-generator/`         |
| Meta Tag Generator | `/seo/meta-tag-generator/`              |


Example:-

For each calculator, create three files in this format
[calculator-name].html
[calculator-name].css
[calculator-name].js

## üé® Page Design & Standards

Each tool must:

- Be **mobile responsive**
- Use basic, clean UI consistent with homepage design
- Include appropriate headings and input/output boxes
- Use proper spacing and font sizes
- Show user-friendly messages or errors when needed

Copy the **header and footer layout** from `landing-page/index.html` if needed for design consistency.

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

- Tools are all **static** (HTML/CSS/JS only)
- No backend or build system required
- Once tool folder is created, it's **ready to go live**
- Place under the correct subdirectory, and link it if needed from the homepage

---

## üìå Additional Notes

- This project will scale up to **50+ tools**
- Future versions may include dynamic rendering (but not now)
- Keep code **clean, minimal, well-indented**
- JS should be vanilla (no jQuery or frameworks)
